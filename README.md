Assignment 1: Edit Distance
Provided at the end of this document are IPA transcriptions of 24 words from various Pashto dialects of 11
regions/cities along with their comparative words in Urdu/English . First two lines correspond to the longitude
and latitude coordinates of the various cities.
Instructions
You need to carry out the following steps for completion of this task:
1. Write code for computing Levenshtein Distance (Edit distance)
Using the algorithms mentioned in slides, prepare code for computing the edit distance. Write your own
code. Donâ€™t use ready-made libraries. You need to modify the edit distance metric such that it is able to
report the distance as a similarity on a percentage scale.
2. Write a Calling code that is able to call the Distance metric multiple times (i.e for each pair of
cities.
A table showing the average scores should be shown, where rows and columns mention names of each
of the cities and a cell location corresponds to the average similarity measure (in percentage) between
the two cities.
3. Bonus
A plot (similar to one shown in slide 24) showing the edit distance as a line between two cities. The
thickness / opacity of the line can be adjusted based on the edit distance score.
Deliverable

Your deliverable should contain only 1 zip file. The name of the zip file should be your roll number. e.g. 20P-
1234.zip. The zip file should contain the following files:

1. Your code (named as 20P-1234.py or 20P-1234.c or 20P-1234.cpp depending on which language you
use)
2. Screenshot of generated table (named as 20P-1234.jpg)
3. Screenshot of generated map (if done. Named as 20P-1234-map.jpg)
